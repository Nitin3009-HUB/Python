Python fudamental project
Python Fundamentals capstone project: Analyzed the columns within the datasets, including project identifiers, employee demographics, and job positions.
Situation: A Python Fundamentals capstone project involves using 3 datasets.
The datasets contain project details, employee information, and designation levels.
Task: Demonstrate Python skills using NumPy and Pandas to perform data cleaning, transformation, and analysis. 
This includes tasks such as handling missing values, splitting columns, joining data frames, and applying conditional logic.
Action: Write Python code in a file to perform tasks like creating Data Frames, imputing values, and applying conditional logic.
Result: Evaluation of the ability to apply Python for data science. Assessment of readiness for real-world data challenges.
